// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Plan catalog — the single source of truth for StoreMink's subscription plans.
//
// Three plans, gated by business maturity:
//   free  → try it         (COD only, subdomain, small catalog)
//   basic → run a business (custom domain, online payments, AI copy)
//   pro   → scale it        (no product limits, staff roles, campaigns)
//
// `stores.plan` holds one of PLAN_IDS (DB CHECK constraint, plans_02_*.sql).
// Plans can be TIMED: `stores.plan_expires_at` (timestamptz, NULL = indefinite)
// bounds an operator-granted plan. Enforcement is two-layered — every read-site
// resolves the plan through effectivePlan() (expired ⇒ free, precise), and the
// daily /api/cron/plan-expiry job durably flips expired rows to free.
//
// Feature gating goes through planAllows()/limits here + the settings registry's
// per-setting `minPlan`. Pricing lives ONLY in this file so repricing is a
// one-line change; billing (Razorpay subscriptions) will consume these values.
//
// Pure module (no server/React imports) — shared by server actions, client
// components, and tests alike. Mirrors lib/settings/registry.ts.
